# Donkey Kong Arcade - Skip Start

This is the Donkey Kong - Skip Start rom-hack for the arcade version of Donkey Kong.

The idea is to have a Donkey Kong version that skips the start game (the first four levels) and immediately starts at L=05.

On most other emulators (e.g. WolfMame) you can play this game by replacing the original dkong.zip by this Skip Start version of the dkong.zip. You have to start the emulator without checksum checking (in WolfMame by starting it from the command line and specifying the romname).
